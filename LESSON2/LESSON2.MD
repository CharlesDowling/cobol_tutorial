# LESSON 2: GETTING AND USING USER INPUT

IN THIS LESSON WE WILL BE USING USER INPUT TO ACQUIRE DATA, STORE IT IN A VARIABLE, AND THE DISPLAY THE DATA ON THE TERMINAL USING DISPLAY.

```
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. USRINP.

       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.

       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01 USERINPUT PIC X(10).

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           ACCEPT USERINPUT FROM SYSIN.
           DISPLAY USERINPUT.
           STOP RUN.

```

THE CODE FOR THIS LESSON WILL GET INPUT, STORE IT AND DISPLAY IT.

----------------------------------------------

CONCEPTS IN THIS LESSON:
---
* USING SYSIN
* PIC KEYWORD
* ACCEPT KEYWORD
* FROM KEYWORD
* STOP KEYWORD
* RUN KEYWORD
* WORKING-STORAGE SECTION

----------------------------------------------

DEFINITIONS:
----
* SYSIN:

	SYSIN IS A KEYWORD THAT ALLOWS A USER TO INPUT DATA INTO THE PROGRAM. IT TELLS THE PROGRAM TO WAIT FOR THE USER TO INPUT WHATEVER DATA THEY DESIRE. AFTER THE USER PRESSES ENTER, IT AUTOMATICALLY FINISHES AND CONTINUES ON TO THE NEXT LINE OF CODE IN THE PROCEDURE DIVISION. 

* ACCEPT:

	ACCEPT IS A KEYWORD CAUSES THE PROGRAM TO TRANSFER DATA TO A VARIABLE PREVIOUSLY DECLARED IN THE WORKING STORAGE SECTION. IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO AN EQUAL SIGN (=). IF THE PHRASE FROM IS OMITTED IT WILL USUALLY DEFAULT TO SYSIN BUT FOR THIS TUTORIAL WE WILL ALWAYS USE “FROM SYSIN” SO WE CAN VISUALLY SEE THE SOURCE OF THE DATA THAT IS BEING STORED.

* FROM:

	FROM IS A KEYWORD THAT TELLS THE PROGRAM WHERE THE DATA WILL BE SOURCED FROM.

* STOP:

	THE STOP KEYWORD EITHER HALTS EXECUTION (LIKE IN THE USAGE OF THIS LESSON), OR CAN PAUSE EXECUTION UNTIL REACTIVATED.

* RUN:

	RUN IS A KEYWORD THAT WHEN USED WITH STOP HALTS EXECUTION ENTIRELY. ALL VARIABLES ARE FREED (“DESTROYED”).

* WORKING-STORAGE SECTION:

	THIS IS THE SECTION OF DATA DIVISION WHERE VARIABLES ARE CREATED, ASSIGNED AND TYPED. 

* PIC:

	PIC/PICTURE IS A KEYWORD WHICH TYPES A VARIABLE. TYPES WILL BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL NEXT LESSON BUT FOR THE CURRENT LESSON A VARIABLE IS DECLARED

----------------------------------------------

BREAKDOWN:
---

THIS PROGRAM IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE. IT INCLUDES THE FOUR DIVISIONS, A PROGRAM-ID AND SOME CODE PRESENT IN THE PROCEDURE DIVISION. SOME OF THE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES IS THE WORKING-STORAGE SECTION, A VARIABLE DECLARATION, A LINE WHICH ACCEPTS USER INPUT:
```
	ACCEPT USER INPUT FROM SYSIN
```

AND THE LINE:

```
	STOP RUN.
```

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AND PROCESS USER DATA WE USE A VARIABLE TO STORE THE DATA TEMPORARILY.

FIRST WE CREATE A WORKING-STORAGE SECTION IN ORDER TO LET THE PROGRAM KNOW WE ARE CREATING VARIABLES. THEN WE INITIALIZE THE VARIABLE.

THE VARIABLE IN THE PROGRAM IS DECLARED USING THE FORMAT: 

* XX (NAME OF VARIABLE) PIC (TYPE ASSIGNED).

IN THIS CASE THE XX IS 01 WHICH TELLS THE PROGRAM IN WHICH LEVEL THE DATA WILL BE STORED. FOLLOWING THE 01 IS THE ACTUAL NAME OF THE VARIABLE. VARIABLES NAMES CAN BE ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE SPACES MATTER YOU CANNOT USE SPACES IN-BETWEEN DIFFERENT WORDS. THIS IS APPARENT IN THE CODE WITH USER INPUT BEING CALLED:

```
	USERINPUT
```

INSTEAD OF:

```
	USER INPUT
```

THE PROGRAM WILL RECOGNIZE USER AS THE VARIABLE AND THEN SEE INPUT WHICH IS A RESERVED KEYWORD AND THROW AN ERROR.

THEN WHEN THE VARIABLE IS NAMED WE USE THE KEYWORD PIC TO ASSIGN A TYPE TO THE VARIABLE AND THE SPECIFY THE TYPE AFTERWARDS WHICH IN THIS CASE IS “X(10)”.

AFTERWARDS CREATING THE VARIABLE WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT BUT WE NEED A WAY TO ASSIGN A VARIABLE TO IT. THAT’S WHY WE USE THE LINE:

```
	ACCEPT USERINPUT FROM SYSIN.
```

THIS LINE CAUSES THE INPUT THE USER PROVIDES AT THE TERMINAL TO BE STORED WITHIN THE VARIABLE “USERINPUT”.

AFTERWARDS WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE VARIABLE IS CORRECTLY INPUTTED SO WE DISPLAY IT WITH THE DISPLAY KEYWORD.

```
	DISPLAY USERINPUT
```

AND FINALLY WE TELL THE PROGRAM TO END EXECUTION BY USING THE COMMAND:

```
	STOP RUN
```
