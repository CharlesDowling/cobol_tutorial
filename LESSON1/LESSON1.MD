# LESSON 1: HELLO WORLD.
IN THIS LESSON WE WILL BE COVERING THE GENERICALLY FOUND "HELLO WORLD" PROGRAM IN COBOL.

THE ACCOMPANYING CODE UNDER HELLOWORLD.COB WHEN EXECUTED WILL DISPLAY AS AN OUTPUT ON ANY TERMINAL "HELLO WORLD"

-------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN FIRST LOOKING AT THE PROGRAM IT'S STRUCTURE IS READILY APPARENT. 
COBOL IS A LANGUAGE THAT IS STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT ALL PARTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE SEPERATED INTO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS.

THERE ARE 4 DIVISIONS:
```
  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
  ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
  DATA DIVSION.
  PROCEDURE DIVISION.
```

IDENTIFICATION DIVSION:
---
  THIS IS THE DIVISION WHERE CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE PROGRAM ARE WRITTEN SUCH AS THE AUTHOR OF THE PROGRAM, THE 
  PROGRAM'S NAME AND OTHER IMPORTANT DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION.

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION:
---
  THIS IS THE DIVISION WHERE THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PROGRAM IS SPECIFIED.

DATA DIVSION:
---
  THIS IS THE SECTION WHERE YOU DECLARE AND ASSIGN VARIABLES AND AQUIRE OUTSIDE DATA FOR USAGE IN YOUR PROGRAM.

PROCEDURE DIVISION:
---
  THIS IS THE DIVISION WHERE CODE IS ACTUALLY EXECUTED.

ALL OF THESE DIVSIONS ARE PRESENT WITHIN HELLOWORLD.COB. ALTHOUGH YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TO HAVE IDENTIFICATION DIVSION
AND PROCEDURE DIVISION TO RUN A COBOL PROGRAM ALL DIVSIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED IN ORDER TO ASSURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
SECTIONS BECAUSE ANY REAL PROGRAM WILL HAVE ALL FOUR DIVISIONS.

WITHIN THE IDENTIFICATION DIVSION YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING CALLED "PROGRAM-ID". THIS IS WHERE WE NAME THE 
PROGRAM. THIS IS SEPERATE FROM THE FILE NAME BUT IT IS GOOD PRACTICE TO NAME IT THE SAME AS THE FILE NAME OMMITING THE EXTENTION ".COB" OR ".CBL".

WITHIN THE PROCEDURE DISION THERE IS ONLY ONE LINE OF CODE WHICH CURRENTLY RESIDES: 
```
DISPLAY 'HELLO WORLD'.
``` 
THIS COMMAND OUTPUTS WHATEVER IS AFTER THE KEYWORD "DISPLAY" TO THE TERMINAL SCREEN. YOU COULD REPLACE IT WITH ANYTHING AND IT WOULD OUTPUT IT TO THE TERMINAL THE SAME AS "HELLO WORLD".

SYNTAX:
---

YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A PATTERN IN THE WAY THE CODE IS WRITTEN. AFTER CERTAIN KEYWORDS AND CODE ARE PERIODS, THIS IS
INTENTIONAL. THE LANGUAGE WAS DESIGNED AFTER THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND AT THE END OF EACH LINE OF CODE YOU PLACE A PERIOD
IN ORDER TO TELL THE COMPILER THAT THE LINE OF CODE IS COMPLETED.
