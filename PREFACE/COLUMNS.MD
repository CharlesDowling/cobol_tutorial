DUE TO THE AGE OF COBOL, THE LANGUAGE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO USE PUNCH CARDS. THE EFFECT OF THIS IS PRESENT IN THE LANGUAGE EVEN TODAY. BELOW IS AN EXPLANATON OF THE COLUMNS IN COBOL AND HOW THEY FUNCTION.

COLUMN FIELDS:
  * 1-6: SEQUENTIAL NUMBERS
    * 1-3: PAGE NUMBER
    * 4-6: LINE NUMBER
  * 7: COMMENTS/CONTINUATION
  * 8-11: AREA A
  * 12-72: AREA B
  * 73-80: IDENTIFICATION

SEQUENTIAL NUMBERS: NUMBERS WHICH HELP TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY LINES OF CODE ARE PRESENT WITHIN THE PROGRAM. MOSTLY OBSOLETE ON MODERN SYSTEMS, REQUIREMENT OF OLDER SYSTEMS. CAN BE USED IF YOU PREFER.

  PAGE NUMBER: DENOTES THE AMOUNT OF PAGES

  LINE NUMBER: DENOTES THE AMOUNT OF LINES IN THE PROGRAM

LUCKY NUMBER 7: DECLARES EITHER COMMENTS OR A CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS LINE OF CODE.

AREA A: All OF THE DIVISION, SECTION, PARAGRAPH HEADERS, CLAUSES AND PARAGRAPH NAMES ARE DECLARED AND START IN THIS AREA.

AREA B: ALL OTHER STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS START IN THIS AREA: SENTENCES AND STATEMENTS.

IDENTIFICATION: NOT USED BUT PRESENT BECAUSE OLDER PUNCH CARDS UTILIZED THESE COLUMNS.
