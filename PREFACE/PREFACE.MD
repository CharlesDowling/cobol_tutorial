COBOL IS A OLDER LANGUAGE DESIGNED TO WORK ON LEGACY MAINFRAME SYSTEMS THAT IS STILL IN USE TODAY. DUE TO IT'S AGE, SOME 
THINGS NEED TO BE DISCUESS AND REVIEWED BEFORE WE START CODING IN COBOL. COBOL LACKS CERTAIN FEATURES THAT ARE PRESENT IN 
MODERN LANGUAGES. THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:
  *LIMITATIONS ON THE LENGTH OF LINES IN CODE.
  *COLUMN DEPENDENT CODING STRUCTURE
  *RIGID STRUCTURE
  *HIGH NUMBER OF RESERVED KEYWORDS
  *(SOME MORE THINGS MAY BE ADDED TO THIS LIST IN THE FUTURE)

LIMITATIONS ON THE LENGTH OF LINES IN CODE:
 MOST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WILL ALLOW LINES OF CODES TO HAVE LONG AND WIDE EXPRESSIONS AND COMMANDS IN A SINGLE LINE.  
 COBOL DOES NOT. COBOL DUE TO IT'S COLUMN DEPENDENT CODING STRUCTURE (SEE BELOW) IS LIMITED TO ### CHARACTERS PER LINE
 OF CODE. THERE ARE WORK AROUNDS WHERE THE CODE CAN BE CONTINUED ON THE NEXT LINE BUT THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED LATER ON.

COLUMN DEPENDENT CODING STRUCTURE:
 COBOL WAS ORIGINALLY STANDARDIZED IN 1968. THE INFLUENCES OF THE LEGACY SYSTEMS OF DECADES AGO ARE STILL PRESENT IN 
 MODERN COBOL SYNTAX. THE ORIGINAL MACHINES THAT RAN COBOL USED PUNCH CARDS AND THE STANDARDIZED SIZE OF PUNCH CARDS 
 ARE THE REASON FOR THE COLUMN DEPENDENT CODING STRUCTURE. THIS WILL PROBABLY NOT CHANGE ANYTIME SOON SO YOU SHOULD 
 ACCUSTOM YOURSELF WITH WRITING SHORTER MORE CONCISE LINES OF CODE FOR YOUR PROGRAMS.

RIGID STRUCTURE:

HIGH NUMBER OF RESERVED KEYWORDS:
